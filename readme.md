# States, Countries and Fruits Laravel API

This Laravel API was created for the purpose of a user who wants to input data regarding the states they have visited, the countries they have visited and the fruits they have eaten into a database. Thanks to Representational State Transfer, or REST, users have the ability to create, read, update or delete content within their database via AJAX. There are four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, which allow users to request changes to their entries in the database.
